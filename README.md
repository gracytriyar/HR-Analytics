# HR Analytics Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates **end-to-end HR Analytics** by integrating data between Python, MySQL, and Power BI.  
The objective is to analyze HR data to understand **workforce composition, attendance & leave patterns, and the hiring funnel**, and to present actionable insights through dashboards.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python** → Imported raw data into MySQL, automated loading  
- **MySQL** → Data profiling, querying, and transformation using SQL  
  - Used **CASE statements** for conditional analysis  
  - Applied **CTEs** (Common Table Expressions) for complex queries  
  - Performed **aggregate functions** (SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc.) for metrics  
- **Power BI** → Built interactive dashboards for visual insights  

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:  

- **Power BI Desktop** → Main data visualization platform used for creating the report.  
- **Power Query** → Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing raw data.  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** → Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.  
- **Data Modeling** → Relationships established among tables (e.g., sales, customers, products) to enable cross-functional insights.  
- **Bookmarks** → Implemented to enable dynamic navigation and visibility (e.g., switching between different dashboard views such as *Product Analysis* or *Geographical Analysis*).  
- **File Formats** → `.pbix` (development file) and `.png` (dashboard preview images).

## 📊 Key Analyses
- **Workforce Composition** → Employee distribution by department, role, gender, and salary  
- **Attendance & Leave Analysis** → Trends in leaves, absenteeism, and productivity  
- **Hiring Funnel** → Applicants → Interviews → Offers → Joinees
